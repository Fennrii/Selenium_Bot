Technical Info &amp; Data Standards
, 
Read-Only RESTful API endpoints that provide patient data
                                    using the
                                    FHIR data standard (DSTU &amp; R4).
, 
RESTful APIs (500+ routes) enabling Read and Write
                                    transactions across an
                                        expansive array of EHR data using a proprietary NextGen JSON data
                                    standard. FHIR APIs may also be used for NGE Client-Facing applications.


User Audience
, 
Apps powered by Patient Access APIs are used by individual patients
                                    of NextGen Practices.
, 
Apps powered by Enterprise APIs (and FHIR -powered apps that are not for the Patient Access use case) are intended for NextGen Enterprise
                                        Users.


Functional Scope
, 
Patient Access API Apps let patients of a NextGen Practice access their own
                                        personal health
                                        data within that Practice's NextGen Enterprise system via API using a
                                    web-based or
                                    native mobile application.
, 
NGE user-facing apps (powered by Enterprise and/or FHIR APIs) integrate with NextGen Enterprise (5.9.0+) to add value &amp;
                                    expand functionality for NextGen Clients across an extensive variety of clinical,
                                        administrative, and
                                        other functions.
